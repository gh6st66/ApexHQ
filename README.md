# ApexHQ

ApexHQ is a multi-service application for Apex Legends tactical meta analysis.
This repository contains the frontend UI, backend API, and data scraping
services.

## Structure

- `frontend/`: UI app (framework to be defined)
- `backend/`: API and processing service
- `scraping/`: data collection and ingestion tools

## Getting started

Each service will have its own README with local setup instructions once the
stack is chosen. For now, pick a service and add your implementation under the
corresponding folder.
